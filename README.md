made for (and all credit goes to): https://github.com/artumino/VRScreenCap

framework: https://github.com/G33kDude/Neutron.ahk

download: https://github.com/samfisherirl/Artum-VR_Screen_Cap-Gui/releases

testing: https://streamable.com/k56zr7
 
Things I need to do:

- ~~github downloader~~

- ~~close gui when not active with menu place holder for resources saving~~

- ~~hotkeys~~

- visual log reader

drop GUI ahk file in  'main files' folder to run

requires autohotkey v1 if uncompiled, compiled gui runs standalone. 

lots to do and clean up. safe to use, at your own risk.
